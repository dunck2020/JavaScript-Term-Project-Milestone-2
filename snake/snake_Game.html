    <h1>Speed Snake</h1>

    <p>This game was one of the first I ever played as a child.  You control a snake around the board,</p>
    <p>try to avoid contact with the walls and yourself and collect gems or snake segments as you move.</p>
    <p>The speed will increase with each collection made and the snake will grow in size.</p>
